## Vinicius Recoaro - Mobile Developer ðŸ‘‹

In last two years, I have directed my efforts towards the development of technology projects, with a special focus on mobile development. Through courses and postgraduate studies, I have improved my skills and knowledge in this area.

I worked as a product developer in the area of mechanical engineering for six years, where I developed advanced skills in project management, including time management, obtaining and filtering information, validating theories, prioritizing tasks, effective communication, teamwork and organization. This set of skills has been fundamental to my professional development and prepares me to face complex challenges effectively and efficiently.
